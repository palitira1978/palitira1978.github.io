The software you download for your Mac in a DMG format can be opened like any other file on a Mac, and then the setup program can be run to install the software. If you have a large DMG file, a progress bar will show until the DMG file is loaded. DMG Extractor opening a 4GB+ DMG file.

Sorry for the oversights; the script was originally written for single DMGs, and I added multiples without really testing it or thinking it through; also we rarely use a special character in a file path because we're so used to working on the web.
