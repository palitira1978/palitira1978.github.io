In this post, we will learnabout Geometer’s Sketchpad and its environment before we use the software.</p><p>Geometer’s Sketchpad (GSP) is a commercial geometry software created my Nicolas Jackiw in the 1980s. It is similar to GeoGebra, but with fewer tools. On the one hand, it is more difficult to construct geometric objects using GSP compared to other dynamic geometry software; but, on the other hand, it can be inferred that because of the lack of tools, it may improve geometric construction knowledge better than many geometry software.</p><p>The Geometer’s Sketchpad (version 4.07) window is shown in the figure below. For now, we will be using this version in our tutorials (I have not bought a new version yet).
