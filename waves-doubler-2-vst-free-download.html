If you don't know how to download the library or if you are having a problem while downloading, you can look at <em>our download guide</em> a few lines above.</blockquote><h3><span>Method 1: Copying the Doubler.dll Library to the Windows System Directory</span><i>link</i></h3><ol><li> The file you downloaded is a compressed file with the extension '<strong>.zip</strong>'. This file cannot be installed. To be able to install it, first you need to extract the dynamic link library from within it. So, first double-click the file with the '<strong>.zip</strong>' extension and open the file.</li><li> You will see the library named '<strong>Doubler.dll</strong>' in the window that opens. This is the library you need to install. Click on the dynamic link library with the left button of the mouse. By doing this, you select the library. </li><li> Click on the '<strong>Extract To</strong>' button, which is marked in the picture. In order to do this, you will need the <strong>Winrar</strong> program. If you don't have the program, it can be found doing a quick search on the Internet and you can download it <em>(The <strong>Winrar</strong> program is free)</em>.</li><li> After clicking the '<strong>Extract to</strong>' button, a window where you can choose the location you want will open. Choose the '<strong>Desktop</strong>' location in this window and extract the dynamic link library to the desktop by clicking the '<strong>Ok</strong>' button. </li><li> Copy the '<strong>Doubler.dll</strong>' library you extracted and paste it into the '<strong>C:WindowsSystem32</strong>' directory. </li><li> If you are using a <strong>64 Bit operating system</strong>, copy the '<strong>Doubler.dll</strong>' library and paste it into the '<strong>C:WindowssysWOW64</strong>' as well. <blockquote><strong>NOTE!</strong> On Windows operating systems with 64 Bit architecture, the dynamic link library must be in both the '<strong>sysWOW64</strong>' directory as well as the '<strong>System32</strong>' directory. In other words, you must copy the '<strong>Doubler.dll</strong>' library into both directories.</blockquote></li><li> In order to complete this step, you must <u>run the Command Prompt as administrator</u>. In order to do this, all you have to do is follow the steps below. <blockquote><strong>NOTE!</strong> We ran the Command Prompt using <strong>Windows 10</strong>. If you are using <strong>Windows 8.1</strong>, <strong>Windows 8</strong>, <strong>Windows 7</strong>, <strong>Windows Vista</strong> or <strong>Windows XP</strong>, you can use the same method to run the Command Prompt as administrator.</blockquote><ol><li> Open the <strong>Start Menu</strong> and before clicking anywhere, type '<em>cmd</em>' on your keyboard. This process will enable you to run a search through the <strong>Start Menu</strong>. We also typed in '<em>cmd</em>' to bring up the Command Prompt. </li><li> Right-click the '<strong>Command Prompt</strong>' search result that comes up and click the <strong>Run as administrator</strong>' option. </li></ol></li><li> Paste the command below into the <strong>Command Line</strong> window that opens and hit the <strong>Enter</strong> key on your keyboard. This command will delete the <strong>Doubler.dll</strong> library's damaged registry (<em>It will not delete the file you pasted into the <strong>System32</strong> directory, but will delete the registry in <strong>Regedit</strong>. The file you pasted in the <strong>System32</strong> directory will not be damaged in any way</em>). <blockquote>%windir%System32regsvr32.exe /u Doubler.dll</blockquote></li><li> If you are using a <strong>64 Bit</strong> operating system, after doing the commands above, you also need to run the command below. With this command, we will also delete the <strong>Doubler.dll</strong> library's damaged registry for <strong>64 Bit</strong> (<em>The deleting process will be only for the registries in <strong>Regedit</strong>. In other words, the dll file you pasted into the <strong>SysWoW64</strong> folder will not be damaged at all</em>). <blockquote>%windir%SysWoW64regsvr32.exe /u Doubler.dll</blockquote></li><li> We need to make a clean registry for the dll library's registry that we deleted from <strong>Regedit (Windows Registry Editor)</strong>. In order to accomplish this, copy and paste the command below into the <strong>Command Line</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong> key. <blockquote>%windir%System32regsvr32.exe /i Doubler.dll</blockquote></li><li> If you are using a <strong>64 Bit</strong> operating system, after running the command above, you also need to run the command below. With this command, we will have added a new library in place of the damaged <strong>Doubler.dll</strong> library that we deleted. <blockquote>%windir%SysWoW64regsvr32.exe /i Doubler.dll</blockquote></li><li>If you did the processes in full, the installation should have finished successfully. If you received an error from the command line, you don't need to be anxious. Even if the Doubler.dll library was installed successfully, you can still receive error messages like these due to some incompatibilities. In order to test whether your dll issue was fixed or not, try running the program giving the error message again. If the error is continuing, try <strong>the 2nd Method</strong> to fix this issue.</li></ol><h3><span>Method 2: Copying the Doubler.dll Library to the Program Installation Directory</span><i>link</i></h3><ol><li> First, you must find the installation directory of the program (the program giving the dll error) you are going to install the dynamic link library to. In order to find this directory, '<strong>Right-Click &gt; Properties</strong>' on the program's shortcut. </li><li> Open the program installation directory by clicking the <strong>Open File Location</strong> button in the '<strong>Properties</strong>' window that comes up. </li><li> Copy the <strong>Doubler.dll</strong> library into the directory we opened. </li><li> The installation is complete. Run the program that is giving you the error. If the error is continuing, you may benefit from trying the <strong>3rd Method</strong> as an alternative.</li></ol><h3><span>Method 3: Uninstalling and Reinstalling the Program That Is Giving the Doubler.dll Error</span><i>link</i></h3><ol><li> Open the <strong>Run</strong> tool by pushing the '<strong>Windows</strong>' + '<strong>R</strong>' keys found on your keyboard. Type the command below into the '<strong>Open</strong>' field of the <strong>Run</strong> window that opens up and press <strong>Enter</strong>. This command will open the '<strong>Programs and Features</strong>' tool. <blockquote>appwiz.cpl</blockquote></li><li> On the <strong>Programs and Features</strong> screen that will come up, you will see the list of programs on your computer. Find the program that gives you the dll error and with your mouse right-click it. The right-click menu will open. Click the '<strong>Uninstall</strong>' option in this menu to start the uninstall process. </li><li> You will see a '<em>Do you want to uninstall this program?</em>' confirmation window. Confirm the process and wait for the program to be completely uninstalled. The uninstall process can take some time. This time will change according to your computer's performance and the size of the program. After the program is uninstalled, restart your computer. </li><li>After restarting your computer, reinstall the program.</li><li>This method may provide the solution to the dll error you're experiencing. If the dll error is continuing, the problem is most likely deriving from the <strong>Windows</strong> operating system. In order to fix <strong>dll errors deriving from the Windows operating system</strong>, complete <strong>the 4th Method</strong> and <strong>the 5th Method</strong>.</li></ol><h3><span>Method 4: Fixing the Doubler.dll Error Using the Windows System File Checker</span><i>link</i></h3><img src='https://samesound.ru/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/izotope-vocal-doubler-free-1.jpg' alt='Waves Doubler 2 Vst Free Download' title='Waves Doubler 2 Vst Free Download'><ol><li> In order to complete this step, you must <u>run the Command Prompt as administrator</u>.

You can see the progress on the <strong>Command Line</strong>. Wait for this process to end. After the scan and repair processes are finished, try running the program giving you errors again.</li></ol><h3><span>Method 5: Fixing the Doubler.dll Error by Manually Updating Windows</span><i>link</i></h3><p>Some programs need updated dynamic link libraries. When your operating system is not updated, it cannot fulfill this need. In some situations, updating your operating system can solve the dll errors you are experiencing.</p><p>In order to check the update status of your operating system and, if available, to install the latest update packs, we need to begin this process manually.</p><p>Depending on which Windows version you use, manual update processes are different.
