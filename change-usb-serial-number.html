Do not change any of the other parameters.</p><p>Some multiplayer games that implement the PunkBuster anti cheat system get cheaters off the server using hardware bans. It used to ban the hard disk serial number but no longer does that since there are ways to spoof and temporarily change the so-called hardcoded serial number. So now they’ve started to ban the CD-Key. Other than that, some licensing system also uses the hard disk serial number to generate a unique hardware ID which is then used to generate an external license file to activate the software.</p><p>A simple way to find your current hard disk volume serial number is to open a command prompt (Win key+R and type cmd) and then type <strong>dir</strong>. The second line shows your volume serial number for the system C partition. Type dir [driveletter:] and it will show a different serial number even if the volume is on the same physical hard drive. The volume serial number changes every time you format the partition and Windows also uses this value during activation so you can’t simply move your install from one partition to another. If your Windows has been activated using a product key from a sticker it will probably ask for the key again after a reboot and will need reactivating if you change the volume serial number on the system drive.</p><p>If you do a simple search in Google, you’ll find tons of information about to change your hard disk volume serial number, but not the real hard disk serial number that is hard coded into the hardware. Some people said that it is impossible to change it, but we will show you that there are ways to change both volume and hard coded serial numbers for your hard disk.</p>1. <strong>Hard Disk Serial Number Changer</strong><p>There are a few free tools around capable of changing the volume serial number and one of them is called <strong>Hard Disk Serial Number Changer</strong>. The name is a bit misleading though as it doesn’t actually change the hard disk serial number but the volume serial number which is different. It works on just about any Windows operating system from 98 onward and is a standalone portable executable but does need to be run as administrator on Vista and 7.</p><p>Usage is pretty straightforward and you simply choose your drive from the drop down box, enter the new serial number and click the Change button. Do note the serial number format as mentioned in the window is made up of 8 hex characters from 0-9 and A-F split by a “-” into two groups of 4. You will then need to reboot to commit the changes.</p><p><strong>Download Hard Disk Serial Number Changer</strong></p><p>2. <strong>VolumeID</strong></p><p>Another useful tool to change the volume serial number is by Sysinternals called <strong>VolumeID</strong>. This tool is only usable from the command line so won’t be as quick and easy to use for some people as Hard Disk Serial Number Changer. The command line usage to change the ID of a drive volume/partition is:</p><p><strong>volumeid [driveletter:] xxxx-xxxx</strong></p><p>The format is again 4 hex characters, a “-” followed by another 4 hex characters. You should shut down all your running applications before using this tool and will need to reboot immediately after the changes if they are being made on an NTFS partition.</p><p><strong>Download Sysinternals VolumeID</strong></p><img src='http://intensiveeternal.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/3/8/123825912/262501392.png' alt='Change usb drive id' title='Change usb drive id'><p>The tools above are fine for changing the serial number of a volume/partition but trying to change the serial number of the actual hard drive itself is a whole different story. These are hard coded into the hard drive itself and cannot simply be edited or altered using a piece of software. There are however, several tools around that can spoof the hard drive’s built in serial number temporarily which can hopefully fool whatever software you are trying to get round. Unfortunately a lot of these tools aren’t free and some are even approaching $100 to buy.</p><p>3. <strong>PB DownForce</strong></p><p>There is a free tool that’s been around for quite a while called PB DownForce which is able to temporarily spoof your hard drive’s static serial number into a different random or seeded number. There is also an option to set your own predefined serial number although we were unable to get that function to work during testing. To use the program in it’s simplest form, all you have to do is start it up and click on the Start spoofing button. Make sure to run PB DownForce as administrator.</p><p>The Advanced options button shows the 3 different types of spoofing to choose, although as mentioned we couldn’t get method 3 to work as intended and it just showed a serial full of a single number. You can easily use the Stop Spoofing button and try another random number. Perform test will quickly tell what drive model name and serial has been given. The image below shows a new serial after using PB DownForce to change a hard disk serial number in the PC Wizard hardware information tool. Do note that some tools such as Speccy will still show the original serial number for the drive because they gather their data in another way, HWInfo does something different again and will show the spoofed drive as another completely new hard drive in its list.</p><p>PB DownForce was tested and worked on Windows XP and Windows 7 32-bit although it still was quite random to which machines worked and which showed no change or produced an error. 64-bit Windows is not supported in any free hard drive spoofing tools we came across. The spoofed serial will return to normal after a reboot.</p><p><strong>Download PB DownForce</strong></p><p>There are several more hard disk serial number Spoofing tools on page 2.</p>12Next ›  View All<h3><iclass='fa fa-cog=' fa-spin' ='=""> You might also like:</iclass='fa></h3>11 Tools to Find out Information About Your Computer’s Hardware4 Ways to Change Windows System Restore Disk Space Usage5 Tools To Get An On Screen Volume Level Indicator4 Tools To Auto Adjust System Volume At Specific TimesAbout $Recycle.bin, Recycler and System Volume Information Folders in Windows<h3><iclass='fa fa-comments-o'='> 39 Comments - Write a Comment</iclass=' fa=""></iclass='fa></h3><div><spanclass='fn'><spanitemprop='name'>Nicholas<spanclass='ago'>5 months ago</spanclass='ago'></spanitemprop='name'></spanclass='fn'></div><p>so you mean reboot in restart you computer or reset you whole computer?</p>Reply<p>Reboot as in restart.

They are installed automatically. If they are not installed automatically, contact the device manufacturer. For the list of USB device class driver included in Windows, see USB device class drivers included in Windows.</p><h3>Windows 10</h3><p>In Windows 10, a new INF, Usbser.inf, has been added to %Systemroot%Inf that loads Usbser.sys as the function device object (FDO) in the device stack. If your device belongs to the Communications and CDC Control device class, Usbser.sys is loaded automatically.You do not need to write your own INF to reference the driver. The driver is loaded based on a compatible ID match similar to other USB device class drivers included in Windows.</p><p><code>USBClass_02</code></p><p><code>USBClass_02&amp;SubClass_02</code></p><ul><li>If you want to load Usbser.sys automatically, set the class code to 02 and subclass code to 02 in the Device Descriptor. For more information, see USB communications device class. With this approach, you are not required to distribute INF files for your device because the system uses Usbser.inf.</li><li>If your device specifies class code 02 but a subclass code value other than 02, Usbser.sys does not load automatically. Pnp Manager tries to find a driver. If a suitable driver is not found, the device might not have a driver loaded. In this case, you might have to load your own driver or write an INF that references another in-box driver.</li><li>If your device specifies class and subclass codes to 02, and you want to load another driver instead of Usbser.sys, you have to write an INF that specifies the hardware ID of the device and the driver to install. For examples, look through the INF files included with sample drivers and find devices similar to your device. For information about INF sections, see Overview of INF Files.</li></ul><p>Note</p><p>Microsoft encourages you to use in-box drivers whenever possible. On mobile editions of Windows, such as Windows 10 Mobile, only drivers that are part of the operating system are loaded. Unlike desktop editions, it is not possible to load a driver through an external driver package. With the new in-box INF, Usbser.sys is automatically loaded if a USB-to-serial device is detected on the mobile device.</p><h3>Windows 8.1 and earlier versions</h3><p>In Windows 8.1 and earlier versions of the operating system, Usbser.sys is not automatically loaded when a USB-to-serial device is attached to a computer. To load the driver, you need to write an INF that references the modem INF (mdmcpq.inf) by using the <strong>Include</strong> directive. The directive is required for instantiating the service, copying inbox binaries, and registering a device interface GUID that applications require to find the device and talk to it. That INF specifies 'Usbser' as a lower filter driver in a device stack.</p><p>The INF also needs to specify the device setup class as <strong>Modem</strong> to use mdmcpq.inf. Under the [Version] section of the INF, specify the <strong>Modem</strong> and the device class GUID. for details, see System-Supplied Device Setup Classes.</p><p>For more information, see this KB article.</p><h2>Configure selective suspend for Usbser.sys</h2><p>Starting in Windows 10, Usbser.sys supports USB Selective Suspend. It allows the attached USB-to-serial device to enter a low power state when not in use, while the system remains in the S0 state. When communication with the device resumes, the device can leave the Suspend state and resume Working state. The feature is disabled by default and can be enabled and configured by setting the <strong>IdleUsbSelectiveSuspendPolicy</strong> entry under this registry key:</p><p>To configure power management features of Usbser.sys, you can set <strong>IdleUsbSelectiveSuspendPolicy</strong> to:</p><h2 id='change-usb-volume-serial-number'>Change Usb Volume Serial Number</h2><ul><li><p>'0x00000001': Enters selective suspend when idle, that is, when there are no active data transfers to or from the device.</p></li><li><p>'0x00000000': Enters selective suspend only when there are no open handles to the device.</p></li></ul><p>That entry can be added in one of two ways:</p><ul><li><p>Write an INF that references the install INF and add the registry entry in the <strong>HW.AddReg</strong> section.</p></li><li><p>Describe the registry entry in an extended properties OS feature descriptor. Add a custom property section that sets the <strong>bPropertyName</strong> field to a Unicode string, 'IdleUsbSelectiveSuspendPolicy' and <strong>wPropertyNameLength</strong> to 62 bytes. Set the <strong>bPropertyData</strong> field to '0x00000001' or '0x00000000'. The property values are stored as little-endian 32-bit integers.</p><p>For more information, see Microsoft OS Descriptors.</p></li></ul><h2>Develop Windows applications for a USB CDC device</h2><p>If you install Usbser.sys for the USB CDC device, here are the application programming model options:</p><ul><li><p>Starting in Windows 10, a Windows app can send requests to Usbser.sys by using the <strong>Windows.Devices.SerialCommunication</strong> namespace. It defines Windows Runtime classes that can use to communicate with a USB CDC device through a serial port or some abstraction of a serial port. The classes provide functionality to discover such serial device, read and write data, and control serial-specific properties for flow control, such as setting baud rate, signal states.</p></li><li><p>In Windows 8.1 and earlier versions, you can write a Windows desktop application that opens a virtual COM port and communicates with the device.
